This project allowed me to combine my passion for data analytics with practical, real-world applications to drive informed decisions.

I used MySQL to analyze pizza sales dataset, demonstrating my ability to work with relational databases and extract actionable insights that support business decision-making.



# 🪜 Steps involved in the process:

1. Data Collection: Combined data from multiple Excel files into SQL Server.

2. Data Cleaning: Fixed errors and removed missing data for accuracy.

3. Data Organization: Sorted the data to find trends, like popular pizza toppings.

4. Data Analysis: Used SQL to calculate key metrics like total sales and average orders.

5. Combining Data for Insights: Merged data from different sources to get a complete view of sales.

6. Identifying Trends: Grouped and sorted the data to find patterns and areas to improve

7. Visual Presentation: Added images and backgrounds to make the presentation.



# 📊 Project Overview:

I analyzed a dataset of 21,350 pizza orders to identify key trends and opportunities for improving sales and customer satisfaction.



# 🌟 Key Insights from Analysis

After analyzing, I uncovered :

1️⃣ XXL pizzas underperformed with only 28 orders—suggesting discontinuation.

2️⃣ The "Classic" pizza category emerged as the top choice, reflecting strong customer preference.

3️⃣ Peak sales occur after 11 PM, while minimal activity is observed between 9–11 AM.

4️⃣ The Chicken pizza category offers limited variety (6 types), highlighting potential for expansion.

5️⃣ An average of 138 pizzas per order indicates the need for targeted promotions to boost order size.



# 🌟 Changes to do:

⚡ Removing low-demand products, boosting popular categories.

🍗 Expand Chicken Pizza Varieties: There are only 6 types of Chicken pizzas,     yet they generate the highest revenue. Expanding this category could lead to even greater sales.

⏲️  Adjusting sales timing and focusing on targeted marketing can further drive revenue growth.

🍕 Address Underperforming Sizes: XXL and XL pizzas have low revenue and order counts. Pricing adjustments or bundling offers could help boost their sales.

📈 Promote Other Categories: While Classic Pizzas make up the majority of sales, promoting other categories can help balance customer preferences and increase variety in sales.

🔹 These insights provide a clear guide for making smarter business choices in the pizza industry.
